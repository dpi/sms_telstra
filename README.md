This module is a wholly unsupported and experimental proof-of-concept.

Ideally the SMS domain work would be handled by a module such as smsframework.

This module should have a dependency on a Telstra SMS library. However none 
are available that support Guzzle 6 (6 coming in next Drupal 8 beta).
When this happens, use standard Drupal Composer workflow to fetch required
dependencies.
